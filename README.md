Rush Hour is a traffic jam logic game with an optional timer which challenges novices and experts alike. The main aim of Rush Hour is to arrange the other vehicles by sliding them in such a way that you get your car through the exit of various gridlocks of diverse dimensions (6x6, 8x8,...) which change from one level to another. All you have to do is: slide the blocking cars and trucks in their lanes either vertically or horizontally until you clear the path for the car to escape in order to win some stars. With these stars, you can change the skin of your car or get rid of one car per level and you have to have reached a certain number of stars to be able to get to the harder levels. If you play the game daily you can also be gifted some bonuses like stars or hints.

The game features three levels of difficulty: easy, medium and hard, allowing players to progress at their own pace. These levels will have different features regarding their difficulties. For example, harder levels will have stationary cars/blocks.

The game features a RESET and UNDO button to allow the player to start the level again or undo some moves in case they get stuck in the traffic. There will also be a SETTINGS button by which the user can change some of the optional features such as sound, themes, timer mode and can see the Scoreboard for the current level. Furthermore, there will be a panel at the bottom for the selections such as “play-pause”, “hints”, “undo”, “reset”. To get used to the new features, you can have a look at the provided tutorial any time.

**There's only one rule- don’t get road rage.** :smirk:

Fun for all ages.
